  <div class="info">Fujimoto's most popular work <i>Chainsaw Man</i>, follows Denji, a troubled teen boy longing to follow his dreams and doing anything to do so. The world is in shambles, constantly being wrecked by demons escaping hell. With his newly obtained chainsaw powers, Denji is sent to put a stop to it all, any means possible. <br><br>
  <i> Chainsaw Man</i> is a very gory series, along with some comical moments as well. The manga does an excellent job writing realistic characters in a not-so-realistic world. They are easy to connect to and find interesting and relatable. The action in the series is also very well written, drawn, and fast paced. The pacing might be confusing for some, but works well with how chaotic and fast life moves in this world. Overall, this series is the most fleshed out and wel written out of all Fujimoto's works. If you're new to his style, it is reccomeneded to start with this srries, as it is the most accesable and understandable.</div>
